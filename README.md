## About Project
The application will serve a wide audience, including visitors, residents of the two Circassian villages, and anyone interested in learning about our village and Circassian culture in general. It will provide information about local businesses, traditional Circassian cuisine (which is highly sought after by those who relish our dishes), and ways to access these delectable foods. To facilitate this, the app will feature options for purchasing these foods through affiliated stores. Additionally, it will offer recipes for those who wish to try their hand at preparing these dishes at home. Customers who make purchases will also have access to preparation methods post-purchase.

A unique feature of all our dishes is the presence of Circassian cheese, a specialty only available through us. The app will also include details about various businesses, such as their opening hours and locations via Google Maps. This encompasses a range of establishments including shops, restaurants, and even a spa. Furthermore, users can enjoy a collection of photos from recent events that have taken place over the past few years.
